# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction – Market Value Estimation

A machine learning–based web application that predicts the **resale price of used cars** based on vehicle specifications and usage details.
The system helps **buyers, sellers, and dealers** make **data-driven pricing decisions** by estimating fair market value.

The model is deployed as a **real-time Streamlit web application**.
